At Holidaze you can book holidays at various locations that other users who took the step towards venue manager status have listed, you can register and opt in and out of venue manager status.

## Intro
This is my project exam 2 work for my 2nd year of FEU at Noroff. It will be written in the React javascript framework with Vite to allow for much faster build times and using Tailwindcss for majority of the styling and some very minor css done in stylesheets.</br>
It will be hosted thanks to Netlify and have it's initial design done in Figma to shape out the ideas for it.</br>
For work timing and things that must be done I have used GitHub Projects for my Gantt chart and Trello for my Kanban board where I add issues and pain points to resolve.

## Brief
A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.</br>
There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.
